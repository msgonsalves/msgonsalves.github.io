# Manuel Gonsalves
## HCI Portfolio and Design Manifesto

### Introduction
        This semester has completely changed the way I think about designing anything and what the end goal is. Originally, I saw it as a talent that you either had, or you did not, but over the course of the term I have come to realize that just like any other computer science problem or any problem for that matter it can be broken down and solved in a systematic way. From working through different projects that presented different problems I have refined my process and ideas for designing. In the end, what ever is created should be simple enough that a most people should be able to use intuitively. 

### Part 1: You’re Wrong
        The first part of any good design for a project is first to find out what you are trying to even do in the first place. This is possibly the hardest problem that I faced because unlike math or other problems in computer science where there is generally a limited number of answers when it comes to design there is a near infinite number of solutions. This means instead of taking your first idea and running with it you really must think about it, and I found for the most part my first idea was nowhere even close to the best idea. The first project, Design for others (https://medium.com/@tiffanykayo96/design-for-other-technocopia-e2034fbf00eb), helped to really emphasize this point. The project was to re-design a website for mobile phones for a certain demographic. At first, the designing for a certain demographic seemed like a restriction and was going to make the problem harder, but it helped in bringing the scope of the project down. In the first part of the project we focused on all the different ways we could format that page just for men aged 30-40 and what color schemes would work best for the web page. There were a lot of possible solutions, and none of the pages we went with were the first ideas. 



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/msgonsalves/msgonsalves.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/msgonsalves/msgonsalves.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
